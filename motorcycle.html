  <h1>These are two motorcycles I have owned</h1>
  <div id="leftBike">
   <h3>My first bike</h3>
    <p>This is a 1993 Suzuki Katana. The second gear didn't work but other than that it didn't die too often. I got it on a trade for a motorcycle that did not run at all so I would call that a win.</p>

    <h3>My second bike</h3>
    <p>This one is a 2005 Yamaha FZR600. I still have it and look forward to ridding when the weather turns better.</p>
